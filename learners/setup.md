## Installing Git

Since several Carpentries lessons rely on Git, please see
[this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup] for
instructions on installing Git for various operating systems.

- [Git installation on MacOS][workshop-setup]
- [Git installation on Linux][workshop-setup]

## Preparing Your Working Directory

We'll do our work in a new project folder wherever you keep coding projects. Change your working directory to the parent directory
of your projects. For instance, if you keep your projects in a directory called "projects" in your home directory, change into it with:

```bash
$ cd
$ cd projects
```

If you keep your projects in a folder on your desktop, change to your desktop folder with:

```bash
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
```
